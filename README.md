# Computational Neuroscience Coursework COMS30017 (2023/24)

Mark: 87%

## Introduction

The coursework consisted of 6 questions and questions 3 and 6 were open-ended, meaning we (as students) had the freedom to experiment with what we thought was a good idea.

The marking scheme reflected this as questions 1, 2, 4 and 5 were 10 points each and questions 3 and 6 were 15 each respectively.
Bit more on the marking scheme 70%+ ~ A in the US system and 90%+ publish worthy work.

The code is largely divided based on a question it is intended to solve but may be used somewhere else as a helper function and I didn't bother putting it in the utils, which contain some of the functions used throughout the code.
