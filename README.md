# Computational Neuroscience Coursework COMS30017 (2023/24)

### Mark: 87% (Marked by Dr. Conor Houghton)

Notes from the marker:

Nice graphs apart from the tiny caption, resize in code not in the document! Great answer to question 3 with interesting graphs, very innovative; Q6 was also interesting though not a complete. Well done.

Q1 - 9 | Q2 - 9 | Q3 - 15 | Q4 - 8 | Q5 - 8 | Q6- 12

## Introduction

The coursework consisted of 6 questions and questions 3 and 6 were open-ended, meaning we (as students) had the freedom to experiment with what we thought was a good idea.

The marking scheme reflected this as questions 1, 2, 4 and 5 were 10 points each and questions 3 and 6 were 15 each respectively.
Bit more on the marking scheme 70%+ ~ A in the US system and 90%+ publish worthy work.

The code is largely divided based on a question it is intended to solve but may be used somewhere else as a helper function and I didn't bother putting it in the utils, which contain some of the functions used throughout the code.

Some of the code takes longer to execute, i.e. upwards of 45 - 60 minutes depending on the CPU. The code does scale linearly with the number of CPU threads, excluding some overhead.
